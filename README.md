# customer-behavior-of-snappfood

Nowadays using online services to fulfill needs is so common because of the comfort they provide. It becomes interesting to know that these services have a wide spectrum, from buying tickets to purchasing clothes. In Iran like in other countries, we can have access to these services through some applications like Digikala or Snapp, however, analyzing the customersâ€™ behavior is essential to keep the businesses that provide these services afloat; so, in this report, I am going to analyze a dataset from Snappfood in order to see how different features like discount cost or discount type affect the customer retention and purchase basket of customers.

in order to do this I will answer 4 questions

1. How to create cohort analysis chart?

2. What is the number of orders in July from new customers?

3. Analyzing purchase behavior of customers' first order.

4. How the intervals between 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th orders change?

in order to find the answers to the above questions you can checkout these notebooks in order
